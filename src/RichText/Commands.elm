advantage of native backspace behavior, namely:

  - selection offset = 0, try to delete the previous text node's text
  - selection offset = 1, remove the first character (afterwards, the reduce behavior of `apply`
    may remove the text node)
  - any other offset, return an error to allow browser to do the default behavior

{-| Delete (forward) transform for a single character. This function has a few quirks in order to take
advantage of native delete behavior, namely:

  - selection offset = end of text leaf, try to delete the next text node's text
  - selection offset = 1 - end of text leaf, remove the last character (afterwards, the reduce behavior of `apply`
    may remove the text node)
  - any other offset, return an error to allow browser to do the default behavior
